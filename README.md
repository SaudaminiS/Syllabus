### Course Information
* An introduction, from a practical perspective, into the Java programming language.
* This is not an introduction to Computer Science course.
* It is not required, but expected, for students to have a general knowledge of Object Oriented Programming techniques and Java (or .NET) experience as well.

### Purpose
The purpose and goal of this course is to introduce students to practical Java programming for use in real world concepts.

### Textbook
*No required textbook*

### Recommended Textbooks
The following books are not required; however, if you are serious about learning and working in Java I highly recommend you purchase one or more of the following books.

The first two are *must haves* for any Java engineer's library:

* Core Java, Volume I, 9th ed.; Horstmann, Cornell. **ISBN-13 978-0137081899**
* Effective Java, 2nd ed.; Joshua Bloch **ISBN-13 978-0321356680**
* Java Concurrency in Practice; Goetz et al. **ISBN-13 978-0321349606**
* Core Java, Volume II, 9th ed.; Horstmann, Cornell. **ISBN-13: 978-0137081608**

### Exams

There are **no** exams for this course! Yaaaay =]

(we may have a pop-quiz or two though... See [Grading](#grading) for overall grade percentage)

### Homework
There will be **7** homework assignments throughout the semester, each required and each building off of the previous. All assignments are code-based mini-projects.

If you join the class late, you will be required to make up all of the previous homeworks.

Homework assignments will be posted immediately after each lecture. They will be due at **4 pm** the day the homework is due (every homework will have a **Due Date** clearly labelled).

The process for viewing and submitting homework assignments is:
* I will post the homework assignments immediately after the lecture (via a `git push`)
* You will work on your assignment and commit locally (via `git commit`)
    - I will review the latest commit *up to* **4 pm** the day the homework is due
* Only **after 4 pm** should you push your changes to your forked repository (via a `git push`) and then issue a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for your completed work thus making it available for grading.

**Late submissions will be counted as a 0**. Submitting homework *after* **12 midnight** on the day it's due will be considered **Late**. Remember - only commits prior to the **4 pm** deadline will be counted regardless of when it's pushed.

**Important** If any part of this process does not make sense please let me know **As Soon As Possible!** via e-mail or in the first lecture.

See [Grading](#grading) for overall grade percentage.

### Course Project

* There will be a single project assigned at the beginning of the semester, due at the end of the semester
* This is an individual project - no groups.
* A list of project ideas will be posted on the first day of class.
    - Students are expected to have selected their project topic by the 2nd class.
	- Students may change their project selection no later than the 3rd class.
* All projects will receive *one, or more,* required addendums prior to the project's due date.

See [Grading](#grading) for overall grade percentage.

### Grading
Student grades will be determined by the combined scores of quizzes, homeworks and the course project.

| Activity | Overall Grade Percentage |
| :------- | :---------------------- |
| Quizzes  | 10% |
| Homeworks | 45% |
| Project | 45% |

### Participation

Ask as many questions as you have. I would encourage you to ask the questions in class by raising your hand. However, I understand that you may not feel comfortable asking in front of a large group and so would prefer to ask your question anonymously. To facilitate as many questions in-class as possible, each lecture I will be opening a stream on [streme.co](http://streme.co/) to allow anyone to ask questions anonymously. I will have the stream running throughout lecture and will answer questions as they are asked. I will post the unique stream URL for the lecture at the start of the lecture. 

### Tips for Homework
* Your code must compile and be tested to work. If it does not compile or execute, it is better to leave a comment explaining what you have completed and what you've tried to fix the issue with as you may receive partial credit.
* Comment your code. Class, method and inline comments are recommended, but feel free to keep them brief (as long as they're descriptive).
* For consistency, follow the [Sun Code Conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html) as closesly as possible. For example:
    - Class names begin with an upper case character
    - Constants (`static final`) variables are all upper case.
    - Methods and variable names should be camel-case (i.e., begin with a lower case and then use an upper case character to distinguish second and subsequent words; e.g., `yourClassName`)
* Use descriptive names for variables, methods and classes.

### Collaboration
* Peer assistance on homework and the course project is recommended. When working with a peer, questions and responses should be given in English (or another natural language) and without the use of code.
* Copying code, even if copied with the original author’s permission, will be considered and reported as cheating. A `0` will be given for the assignment and, pending the severity of the copied code, an `F` may be given for the course.

### Office Hours
If you want to meet me prior to class please email me so that I can ensure I'm available promptly at 3:30 pm. If you do not email me in advance I may be late getting to office hours. Additionally, if the office hours' time does not work for you I will make myself available via Google Hangout (video call).  Just send me an email and we can coordinate a time that will work for both of us.

### GitHub Usage

This class will use [GitHub](http://github.com) extensively. All lectures, homework assignments etc. will happen on the class's [repository](https://github.com/NYU-CS6015/Spring-2015);
To read more about the benefits to this for you as a student, read [here](https://education.github.com/)

You must notify me of your GitHub user id. As soon as you do, I will verify that you're enrolled in the class, and then give you access to the class's private [repository](https://github.com/NYU-CS6015/Spring-2015).  The repository is [Spring-2015](https://github.com/NYU-CS6015/Spring-2015). If you do not have access you will get a 404 message. This means either;
* you haven't given me your GitHub user id
* I have not yet added you
* or you are not logged-in with that user id.

Ensure you have access to this [repository](https://github.com/NYU-CS6015/Spring-2015) **As Soon As Possible!**
Upon getting access you must [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository. This will give you write access to a copied version owned by your user. 

This is a great read if you're unfamiliar with git - [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics)
